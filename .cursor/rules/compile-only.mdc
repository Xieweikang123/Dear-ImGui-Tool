# Code Modification Workflow

## Compilation Only Policy
- After making code changes, **ONLY compile the project**
- **DO NOT run the executable** - the user will run it manually
- Use `.\build-only.bat` to compile the project (NOT `.\build.bat` which auto-runs)
- Wait for compilation to complete successfully
- Do not use `run_terminal_cmd` to execute the built executable

## Workflow Steps
1. Make code changes using appropriate tools (search_replace, MultiEdit, etc.)
2. Check for linter errors with `read_lints`
3. Compile the project with `.\build-only.bat`
4. Confirm successful compilation
5. **Stop here** - let the user run the program manually

## Exception
- Only run the executable if explicitly requested by the user
- Always ask for confirmation before running any executable

This ensures the user maintains full control over when and how the program is executed.
