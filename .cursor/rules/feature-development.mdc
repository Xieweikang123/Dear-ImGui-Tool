# Feature Development Guidelines

## Feature Architecture
- Each feature should be self-contained in its own `.cpp` and `.h` files
- Use the feature manager system for integration
- Implement standard interface: `Initialize()`, `DrawUI()`, `Cleanup()`
- Follow the pattern established in [src/word_reminder.cpp](mdc:src/word_reminder.cpp)

## Feature Interface Pattern
```cpp
namespace FeatureName
{
    const char* GetFeatureName();
    bool IsEnabled();
    void SetEnabled(bool enabled);
    void Initialize();
    void DrawUI();
    void Cleanup();
}
```

## UI Development
- Use Dear ImGui for main interface components
- Consider Windows native controls for specialized functionality (like the word reminder popup)
- Implement proper window management and state persistence
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging

## State Management
- Use static variables or singleton patterns for feature state
- Implement save/load functionality for persistent data
- Handle application lifecycle events properly
- Clean up resources on shutdown

## Testing and Debugging
- Add extensive logging during development
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify proper cleanup and resource management
- Use the shared logging system for consistency

## Integration
- Register features with the feature manager
- Follow existing patterns for menu integration
- Ensure features work well together
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
